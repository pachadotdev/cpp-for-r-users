# Setup

## C++ Setup

To install the required packages for C++ development, I ran the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential g++-11
```

I attempted to compile a simple example to print a number:

```cpp
// save this as snippets/01-print-number.cpp

#include <iostream> // required for the cout function

// function to print a message
int main() {
    std::cout << 1 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

When I tried to compile it with the following bash instruction:

```bash
g++ snippets/01-print-number.cpp -o snippets/01-print-number
```

I encountered the following error:

```bash
fatal error: 'cstdio' file not found
fatal error: 'vector' file not found
cannot find -lc++abi: No such file or directory
```

To resolve this issue, I installed additional packages:

```bash
sudo apt install g++-11 libc++-11-dev libc++abi-11-dev
```

After this, I was able to successfully compile and run the program from bash:

```bash
g++ snippets/01-print-number.cpp -o snippets/01-print-number
./snippets/01-print-number # prints "1"
```

## R Setup

I installed the R packages `bench`, `cpp11`, `devtools` and `usethis` with the following command:

```r
install.packages(c("bench", "cpp11", "devtools", "usethis"))
```

To verify that R can compile C++ code, I ran `pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debug = TRUE)`, which returned the following output:

```r
Trying to compile a simple C file
Running /usr/lib/R/bin/R CMD SHLIB foo.c
using C compiler: ‘gcc (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0’
```
